### update: I implemented another version in typescript that can be more moduled and scalable, you can switch to "[Typescipt](https://github.com/mAmged/simple-exchange-nodejs/tree/typescript)" branch to find it or click [here](https://github.com/mAmged/simple-exchange-nodejs/tree/typescript).
### I couldn't make the order cancellation functionality but this can be done using the same logic like order adding function but instead of adding to the quantity, it will subtract.

### Also I didn't want to make it advanced matching engine, I just used simple order book structure.
